# GesturalOrigins

The Wild Minds Lab is based at the University of St Andrews, together we explore the communication and cognition of wild apes and other species. The Gestural Origins project was set up to establish a large-scale comparison of gesture in individuals, groups, generations, and species. Doing so required a flexible, bottom-up coding scheme that allows features of gesturing to be explored in diverse ways. This repo contains our coding protocol and definition sheets, video examples, and ELAN templates for different species.

You can see a video tutorial of the coding template in use here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoShxy1vYe4&list=PLAidTwBvwFPkRdZ2OMVntnfmfOgozomr6&index=42
